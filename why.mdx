### No KYC Required
To use the Fragment functionality of our service, you don't need to verify your identity or go through any verification process...

### No Headaches
No need to write Fragment's complex API from scratch, this is a fully ready solution


### Security
You don't trust your 24-word seed phrase from your TON wallet to third parties or your hosting provider.

> Unfortunately, cases of seed phrase theft from crypto wallets on cheap hosting services are a common occurrence...


### Speed
Our service doesn't use browser emulation or similar things. It's built using pure HTTP requests + TON Web3.0
